Bootstrap Installation
======================

In the command prompt/terminal use the following commands to setup the project:

* `bundle install` - this will install the required gems
* `npm install` - this will install the modules for Grunt
* `grunt watch` - this monitors your assets for changes then compiles them

Optional

* `npm install dploy -g` - this is for deployment. Modify dploy.yaml to reflect your environments - http://leanmeanfightingmachine.github.io/dploy/

That's it. You can use this as the starting point for a static site, or drop it into a WordPress theme.
