js/vendor
=========

Libraries would typically go here, like jQuery or Modernizr.
A custom build of Modernizr is included, which contains detections for the more common features we'd need to look out for.

You can build your own: http://modernizr.com/download/

It's recommended that we load jQuery in from a CDN, which will let us download assets asynchronously.
